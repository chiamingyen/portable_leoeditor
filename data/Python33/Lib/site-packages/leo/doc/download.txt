Leo's core code is always being improved and developed. Unit-testing
ensures that the daily commits are as bug-free as possible. Almost all of
the time, downloading the most recent `nightly snapshot`_ of the
development code is going to give you code that is just as stable and much
more up-to-date than the most recent `latest stable release`_ which most
Leonistas would consider already outdated.

If you are just checking Leo out, feel free to use the `latest stable release`_
download if it makes you feel more secure, but once you've
decided to work with Leo on a regular basis, we highly recommend regularly
keeping your installation up to date with the most recent `nightly snapshot`_.

To summarize, you may get Leo in three ways:

1. Download the `latest stable release`_ from `SourceForge`_. This release
   contains an executable installer. This release will usually be a bit out of date.

2. Download a `nightly snapshot`_ from `Leo's snapshots page`_. This page
   contains .zip archives of Leo's code from 1, 2, 5, 10, 30 and 90 days
   ago.
   
3. Download `Leo's latest sources`_ from `Launchpad`_ using `bzr`_. Once
   bzr is installed, getting the latest version of Leo is very easy.
