Some outline commands
############################

.. index::
    pair: Outline commands; Tutorial

You can use Leo as fairly typical outliner. Click the expansion box of nodes to
show and hide their children.

.. index::
    pair: Tab completion; Tutorial

Play around with some of the commands from the Outline menu or from the
minibuffer. The keyboard shortcut and minibuffer key sequence appear in
parentheses. **Note**: as usual, you can use tab completion in the minibuffer.

Edit Headline (Ctrl+H or <Alt-x>edit-headline<return>)

    Begins editing of the headline text of a node.
    To end editing, hit <return> or <Ctrl-g>

Insert Node (Ctrl+I or <Alt-x>insert-node<return>)

    Inserts a new headline into the outline.

Cut Node (Ctrl+Shift+X or <Alt-x>cut-node<return>)

    Deletes a node and all its descendants, copying them to the clipboard.

Paste Node (Ctrl+Shift+V or <Alt-x>paste-node<return>)

    Pastes a tree copied by the Cut Node command.

Copy Node (Ctrl+Shift+C or <Alt-x>copy-node<return>)

    Copies a node and all its descendants to clipboard without deleting it from
    outline. You can copy a tree from one Leo outline to another using Copy Node
    and Paste Node.

Contract or Go Left (Alt-Left-Arrow or <Alt-x>contract-or-go-left<return)

    Contracts a node if it is expanded, otherwise selects its parent.

Expand and Go Right (Alt-Right-Arrow or <Alt-x>expand-and-go-right<return>)

    Select a node's first child, expanding the original node if needed.

Goto Prev Visible (Alt-Up-Arrow or <Alt-x>goto-prev-visible<return>)

    Select the previous visible node.

Goto Next Visible (Alt-Down-Arrow or <Alt-x>goto-next-visible<return>)

    Select the next visible node.

Move Up (Ctrl+U or <Alt-x>move-outline-up<return>)

    Moves a node up in the outline.

Move Down (Ctrl+D or <Alt-x>move-outline-down<return>)

    Moves a node down.

Move Left (Ctrl+L or <Alt-x>move-outline-left<return>)

    Moves a node left.

Move Right (Ctrl+R or <Alt-x>move-outline-right<return>)

    Moves a node right.

Promote (Ctrl+} or <Alt-x>promote<return>) 

    Makes all the children of a node to be siblings of the node.

Demote (Ctrl+{ or <Alt-x>demote<return>)

    Makes all following siblings of a node to be children of the headline.

Please experiment with Leo's outline now. Move around the tree and
expand/collapse nodes by pressing Alt + arrow keys. This also moves the focus to
tree, so, after pressing Alt + arrow, you can move around by using arrow keys
alone. Return the focus to the body control by pressing Enter.
