    - Improved presentation of autocompletion list.
    - Applied patch for bug 800399: smart word jumps/deletes.

- Code improvements:

    - Most of Leo's core files now import just leo.core.leoGlobals.
    - Global switches are now all in leoGlobals.py.
    - version.py now uses bzr_version.py. Leo now reports bzr version numbers and dates automatically.
    - Unified the high-level interface & eliminated the low-level interface.
    - Create properties for logCtrl & bodyCtrl.
    - Added event filters to top-level frames.
    - Added g.app.isExternalUnitTest.
    - Added c.config.set.

- Created new classes::

    EditCommandsManager
    KeyStroke & ShortcutInfo
    LoadManager

- Dozens of other new commands and features.

For details, see the release notes.
.. @+node:ekr.20120320153011.8201: *5* Weightless unit testing
Small improvements the unit testing framework created big results. They
completely eliminate the overhead in running unit tests:

    - The run-marked-unit-tests-externally (Alt-4) command runs all marked
      @test nodes. To choose tests, just mark them.
    - Alt-4 now saves the .leo file first.
    - Almost all unit tests may now be run externally:
        - External unit tests always read config settings.
        - The nullGui now uses a fully capable string-based body widget.
        - The nullGui now uses the regular undoer.
    - Unit tests now always have the sources available.
    - Disabled messages on external unit tests.
    - The unit test commands always run a selected @test node.

These improvements mean that almost all unit tests may be run externally.
In turn, this creates a remarkable work flow::

    Edit
    Alt-4
    Edit
    Alt-4
    ...

The energy difference between weightless and heavy is astounding. Try the
new way: you will surely like it.

**Notes**:

Experience shows that being able to run the desired unit tests *without*
selecting any particular node makes an amazingly large difference. Being
able to run all and only marked unit tests is a big step forward.

If a marked node is neither an @test node nor an @suite node, all nodes in
the tree are considered to be marked.

@language rest

.. @+node:ekr.20110601105631.19360: *5* Bugs fixed
- Fixed an important bug involving orphan nodes. Leo now never saves an external
  file containing orphan nodes. This ensures that all the information in the
  external file will, in fact, be saved in the .leo file.

- Almost 40 minor bugs have been fixed. For details, see the release notes.

- Fixed mod_http plugin
  
.. @+node:ekr.20110601105631.19484: *5* Deprecated/removed features
- Leo no longer supports the Tk gui. The Qt gui now does everything
  the Tk gui did and better.

- Removed show/hide/toggle minibuffer commands. The minibuffer is an essential
  part of Leo.
  
- These settings are no longer used::
    
    @string selected-background-color
    @string selected-command-background-color
    
- The import-at-root command is no longer supported.
.. @+node:ekr.20110601105631.19481: *5* Major improvements
- Support multiple @language directives in a single node
  As with @color directives, only unambiguous @language directives affect the
  default coloring of descendant nodes.

- Colorize url's in the body text. You can open url's by control-clicking on
  them, or by using the open-url command.

- Use @file extension by default if there is no @language directive in effect.
  This is oh so useful.

- Unified extract commands.  This command creates a child node from the selected
  body text as follows:
    
    1. If the selection starts with a section reference, the section name become the
       child's headline. All following lines become the child's body text. The
       section reference line remains in the original body text.
       
    2. If the selection looks like a Python class or definition line, the
       class/function/method name becomes child's headline and all selected lines
       become the child's body text.
       
    3. Otherwise, the first line becomes the child's headline, and all selected
       lines become the child's body text.

    Note that the extract-section-names command remains.
    The extract-section and extract-python-method commands are gone.

- The import-file commands replaces all the following commands::
    
    import-at-file                    
    import-cweb-files         
    import-derived-file       
    import-flattened-outline      
    import-noweb-files
    
  Leo chooses one of the above commands as follows.  First, if the file looks
  like an external file that Leo wrote, the command works like
  import-derived-file command.  Otherwise, the file's extension determines the
  importer::
        
        .cw, .cweb:     import-cweb-files
        .nw, .noweb:    import-noweb-files
        .txt:           import-flattened-outline
        all others:     import-at-file
    
  The import-at-root command is no longer supported.
.. @+node:ekr.20110602091552.16899: *6* Completed Leo's autocompleter
Terminology: the *legacy* (aka tabbed) autocompleter shows completions in Leo's
tabbed pane. The *new* (aka qcompleter) autocompleter shows completions in or
near the body pane.

Appearance
==========

There is little change to the legacy completer, except that no text is
highlighted in the body pane during completion. This is calmer than before.
Furthermore, there is no longer any need for highlighting, because when the user
types a backspace the legacy completer now simply deletes a single character
instead of the highlighted text.

One minor change: the legacy completer now *does* insert characters that do
not match the start of any possible completion. This is an experimental feature,
but it might play well with using codewise completions as a fallback to
leo-related completions.

Function and design
===================

Both the legacy and new completer now work *exactly* the same way, because they
both use the AutoCompleterClass to compute the list of completions.

The strict "stateless" requirement means that the "intermediate" completions
must be entered into the body pane while completion is active. It works well as
a visual cue when using the tabbed completer: indeed, the tabbed completer would
be difficult to use without this cue.

The situation is slightly different with the qcompleter. Adding code before the
user accepts the completion might be considered an "advanced" feature. However,
it does have two important advantages, especially when "chaining" across
periods: it indicates the status of the chaining and it limits what must appear
in the qcompleter window.

Codewise completions
====================

The codewise-oriented completions appear to work well. In large part,
this is due to adding the global "self." completions to all class-related
completions (kind == 'class' in ac.get_codewise_completions). This looks like a
really good hack, and it eliminates the need for the ContextSniffer class.

Performance
===========

Performance of leo-related completions is *much* better than before. The old
code used Python's inspect module and was horribly complex. The new code uses
eval and is perfectly straightforward.

The present codewise-related code caches completions for all previously-seen
prefixes. This dramatically speeds up backspacing. Global caching is possible
because completions depend *only* one the present prefix, *not* on the presently
selected node. If ContextSniffer were used, completions would depend on the
selected node and caching would likely be impractical. Despite these
improvements, the performance of codewise-oriented completions is noticeably
slower than leo-related completions.

Performance notes
=================

The ac.get_cached_options cuts back the prefix until it finds a cached prefix.
ac.compute_completion_list then uses this (perhaps-way-too-long-list) as a
starting point, and computes the final completion list by calling
g.itemsMatchingPrefixInList.

This may not be absolutely the fastest way, but it is much simpler and more
robust than attempting to do "prefix AI" based on comparing old and new
prefixes. Furthermore, this scheme is completely independent of the how
completions are actually computed. The autocompleter now caches options lists,
regardless of whether using eval or codewise.

In most cases the scheme is extremely fast: calls to get_completions replace
calls to g.itemsMatchingPrefixInList. However, for short prefixes, the list that
g.g.itemsMatchingPrefixInList scans can have thousands of items. Scanning large
lists can't be helped in any case for short prefixes.

Happily, the new scheme is still *completely* stateless: the completionDict does
*not* define state (it is valid everywhere) and no state variables had to be
added. In short, the new caching scheme is much better than before, and it
probably is close to optimal in most situations.
.. @+node:ekr.20110602091552.16898: *6* Greatly improved the viewrendered plugin
The viewrendered plugin creates a window for *live* rendering of images, movies,
sounds, rst, html, etc. 

Commands
========

viewrendered.py creates the following (``Alt-X``) commands:

``viewrendered (abbreviated vr)``
    Opens a new rendering window.
    
    By default, the rendering pane renders body text as reStructuredText, with
    all Leo directives removed. However, if the body text starts with ``<``
    (after removing directives), the body text is rendered as html.
    
    **Important**: The default rendering just described does not apply to nodes
    whose headlines begin with @image, @html, @movie, @networkx, @svg and @url.
    See the section called **Special Renderings** below.

    Rendering sets the process current directory (os.chdir()) to the path
    to the node being rendered, to allow relative paths to work in ``.. image::`` directives.

``hide-rendering-pane``
    Makes the rendering pane invisible, but does not destroy it.

``lock-unlock-rendering-pane``
    Toggles the locked state of the rendering pane. When unlocked (the initial
    state), the rendering pane renders the contents of the presently selected
    node. When locked, the rendering pane does not change when other nodes are
    selected. This is useful for playing movies in the rendering pane.
    
``pause-play-movie``
    This command has effect only if the rendering pane is presently showing a movie.
    It pauses the movie if playing, or resumes the movie if paused.

``show-rendering-pane``
    Makes the rendering pane visible.

``toggle-rendering-pane``
    Shows the rendering pane if invisible, otherwise hides it.
    
``update-rendering-pane``
    Forces an update of the rendering pane. This is especially useful for
    @graphics-script nodes: such nodes are update automatically only when
    selected, not when the body text changes.
    
Rendering reStructuredText
==========================

For example, both::

    Heading
    -------

    `This` is **really** a line of text.

and::

    <h1>Heading<h1>

    <tt>This</tt> is <b>really</b> a line of text.

will look something like:

    **Heading**

    `This` is **really** a line of text.
    
**Important**: reStructuredText errors and warnings will appear in red in the rendering pane.

Special renderings
===================

This plugin renders @image, @html, @movie, @networkx, @svg and @url nodes in
special ways.

For @image, @movie and @svg nodes, either the headline or the first line of body
text may contain a filename.  If relative, the filename is resolved relative to
Leo's load directory. 

- ``@graphics-script`` executes the script in the body text in a context containing
  two predefined variables:
      
    - gs is the QGraphicsScene for the rendering pane.
    - gv is the QGraphicsView for the rendering pane.
    
  Using these variables, the script in the body text may create graphics to the
  rendering pane.

- ``@image`` renders the file as an image.


- ``@html`` renders the body text as html.


- ``@movie`` plays the file as a movie.  @movie also works for music files.

- ``@networkx`` is non-functional at present.  It is intended to
  render the body text as a networkx graph.
  See http://networkx.lanl.gov/


- ``@svg`` renders the file as a (possibly animated!) svg (Scalable Vector Image).
  See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics
  **Note**: if the first character of the body text is ``<`` after removing Leo directives,
  the contents of body pane is taken to be an svg image.

- ``@url`` is non-functional at present.

Settings
========

- ``@color rendering-pane-background-color = white``
  The background color the rendering pane when rendering text.

- ``@bool view-rendered-auto-create = False``
  When True, show the rendering pane when Leo opens an outline.
  
- ``@bool view-rendered-auto-hide = False``
  When True, hide the rendering pane for text-only renderings.

- ``@string view-rendered-default-kind = rst``
  The default kind of rendering.  One of (big,rst,html)

- ``@bool scrolledmessage_use_viewrendered = True``
  When True the scrolledmessage dialog will use the rendering pane,
  creating it as needed.  In particular, the plugins_menu plugin
  will show plugin docstrings in the rendering pane.
  
Acknowledgment
==============

Terry Brown created this initial version of this plugin,
and the free_layout and NestedSplitter plugins used by viewrendered.
.. @+node:ekr.20110601105631.19434: *5* New and improved features
.. @+node:ekr.20110601105631.19435: *6* Colorizing
- Support multiple @language directives in a single node
  As with @color directives, only unambiguous @language directives affect the
  default coloring of descendant nodes.

- Colorize url's in the body text. You can open url's by control-clicking on
  them, or by using the open-url command.

- Added support for cython colorizing

- Leo ignores (and does not color) @language directive for unknown languages.

- Leo completely recolors nodes when you change @language directives by typing.
.. @+node:ekr.20110601105631.19480: *6* Command-line arguments & settings
- The --no-splash command-line option suppresses the splash screen.
  Leo puts up no splash screen when the --silent
  or --script command-line options are given.

- Added @bool view-rendered-auto-create setting.
    
- Added @bool use_qcompleter setting.

- Added auto_tab_complete setting.

- Removed @bool use_codewise setting.

- You now may set icon button colors in the Qt stylesheet.

.. @+node:ekr.20110601105631.19464: *6* File handling
- Added namespace and Leo comment lines to .leo files

- Leo opens leoSettings.leo only once

- Fixed Bug 745824: @doc duplicates comment delims in html files
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/leo-editor/+bug/745824e
  
- Leo no longer wraps @doc lines. This ensures that Leo does not change files
  unnecessarily.
.. @+node:ekr.20110601105631.19441: *6* Gui
- If you type a *plain* up/down arrow key while editing a headline, Leo will act
  as if you had typed the corresponding *alt*- arrow key. That is, Leo will end
  editing of the headline and go to the next previous node. Leo will end editing
  even if there is no next/ previous node, which is convenient.

- A single click on an already-selected tree node edits the headline

  Enabled only if @bool single_click_auto_edits_headline = True.

- Added a splash screen

  The --no-splash command-line option suppresses the splash screen. In addition,
  Leo puts up no splash screen when the --silent or --script command-line
  options are given. To change the splash screen, replace
  leo\Icons\SplashScreen.jpg with another image.

- The apropos commands now print in a separate area if possible. The commands use
  the scrolledmessage plugin if possible, which in turn uses the viewrendered
  plugin by default. This makes the apropos messages much more visible.

- Handle click events like alt-x or ctrl-g Clicking in the minibuffer now is
  equivalent to alt-x, provided that the minibuffer is not in use. Clicking most
  places outside the minibuffer is equivalent to ctrl-g. Catching clicks is much
  safer than catching focus events.

- The first loaded file sets tabbed gui size

- Enter insert mode after ctrl-h.  This is a vim-related improvement.

- Disabled find/change text areas in find panel.  This reduces confusion.
.. @+node:ekr.20110601105631.19482: *6* Improved commands
- Improved the clone-find-all command. The descendants of previously found
  (cloned) nodes don't get added again. The clone-find-all pattern now defaults
  to find text.

- Improved the forward and backward by sentences commands Leo's sentence related
  functions now stop at empty lines, skip periods within words, stop at
  sentences ending in non-periods and stop at the end or beginning of the
  buffer.

- Improved the print-bindings command; it now shows were bindings came from.

- Improved the reformat-paragraph command. The command detects paragraphs more
  reliably. The next line is now visible, which is a big improvement.

- Added patch to g.wrap_lines from José Rojas Echenique
  It regularizes the number of spaces after periods.

- Improved expansion of abbreviations. Abbreviations are checked any time a
  non-word character is typed. In particular, newlines trigger abbreviations,
  which I find very helpful, although I did then have to remove newlines from my
  abbreviations. Control sequences do not trigger expansions.

- Improved handling of @url nodes. The new rule is simple: if the body text
  contains any text the first line of the body text is taken to be the url.
  There is no longer any need to put '--' in the headline. More importantly, you
  can put anything you like in the body text following the first line. Other
  url's, notes, even .. graphics:: directives for the viewrendered plugin.

- Improved the clean-all-lines command. It is now much faster and has better
  feedback.
.. @+node:ekr.20110601105631.19463: *6* New commands
- Added the replace-current-character command. It replaces the character to the
  left of the cursor, or replaces the selection range if there is one.

- Added toggle-case-region command.

- Added save-all command. It saves all changed windows.

- Added insert-hard/soft-tab commands.

- Added commands to manage uA's::

    clear-all-uas
    clear-node-uas
    print-all-uas
    print-node-uas

.. @+node:ekr.20110601105631.19473: *6* Scripting
.. _`Runwith class`: http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/b8e8fbf6d97fa9f2/a4537fafaf2442ba

- Added namespace arg in c.executeScript

- Put Kent Tenney's `Runwith class`_ in scripts.leo and contrib.

  Kent writes, "I've had endless problems with interpreter versioning, leading
  me create the Runwith class. It writes a file to disk, makes it executable,
  runs it, captures exitcode, err and output, removes the files, provides
  reports. This provides complete decoupling from Leo."

- Call os.chdir when executing scripts.
.. @+node:ekr.20110604105805.16766: *5* New in 4.9 b2
- Double-clicking a headline now colorizers the headline exactly the same way as
  when editing the headline with ctrl-H. This was a serious problem for those
  with dark window-color schemes.
  
- The distribution script now ensures that leo\plugins\spellpyx.txt contains
  Linux-style newlines. This prevents crashes in the PyEnchant spell checker.
  
- Leo imports .cfg files just like .ini files.

- Fixed crasher in graphcanvas plugin caused by a bug in CommandChainDispatcher.add.
.. @+node:ekr.20110611085637.5009: *5* New in 4.9 b3
.. @+node:ekr.20110611085637.5010: *6* 4.9 b3: Bugs fixed
- Fixed ancient, major bug: F3 now makes sure to save headline changes

- Fixed old bug: set-find-x commands no longer abort find commands

  The commands that switch find scope, set-find-xxx, no longer terminate the
  find command, if one is active.  This is an old bug, and it's good to fix it. 

- Fixed recent bugs in the viewrendered and scrolledmessage plugins

  An earlier rev fixed a bug that effectively destroyed the viewrendered plugin.
  It was caused by the new convention that alleviates the need for many
  \@language directives. The fix was simply to enable the update_rst method if
  the massaged p.b is not empty.

  ScrolledMessageDialog.convertMessage now renders rst by default, unless
  *either* the html or text button is pressed.  There really should be three
  radio buttons: text, html or rST, but that's a tiny interface glitch.  The
  actual bug however, was much more serious: rst was never being rendered. 

- Fixed chapters problems

    http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/3f15a855ca38b26e
    
    The new code is more relaxed about where @chapter nodes may reside.  They
    are always *created* as the last child of the first @chapters node in the
    outline (the @chapters, plural, node is created as needed).  However, you may
    move them while in the "main" chapter, with no ill effects.  In fact, you could
    swap @chapter nodes with the same name: when you select a chapter, Leo will use
    (show) the first node it finds. 
    
    The new code is now both more careful and more tolerant of @chapter nodes
    deleted by hand.  The chapter will still appear in the dropdown list: if you
    select it you will give a polite warning.  That's all.  In particular, the
    deleted chapter will *remain* in the dropdown list until you use the proper
    chapter-remove command.  That's about the only sane alternative: it allows you
    to resurrect the chapter, by hand or with an undo. 
    
    This is all made possible because the new code is almost completely stateless.
    The only exception is the saved position used to select a node when selecting a
    chapter. The old position-based findPositionInChapter method has been simplified
    to make it work more reliably. It first looks for a "perfect" match using
    positions, and then degrades to looking for a vnode match. In practice, most
    matches are, in fact, perfect. The "imperfect" case typically happens when the
    user alters nodes in @chapter trees by hand in the "main" chapters.
    
    Technical highlights:
        
    - The check for c.positionExists(p) in c.setCurrentPosition continues to fail
      when deleting @chapter nodes. However, the code now simply falls back to
      c.rootPosition, without any apparent harm.
      
    - The chapterController and chapter classes are now completely stateless, except
      for chapter.p.
      
        A. chapter.findPositionInChapter has been simplified and generalized. It now
           falls back to a reasonable value, based on p.v, if chapter.p does not
           exist.
           
        B. All chapterController code now recomputes the location of @chapters and
           @chapter nodes whenever those locations are needed.
           
        C. All chapter commands are unchanged in their actual workings, but all contain
           a care "preamble" of checking code.
           
- Added unit test for all chapter commands.  All interactive commands now have
  an xByName helper for use by unit tests.
  
- Added lockout to leoQtTreeTab.  This prevents flash during the rename chapter command.

- Rewrote chapter.chapterSelectHelper.  This reduces, but does not eliminate, the
  number of warnings given by c.setCurrentPosition.


- Fixed recent bug: handle 'Escape' character properly

  The fix was a last-minute adjustment in leoQtEventFilter.create_key_event.


- Fixed caps-lock problem

  The fix was yet another last-minute fix leoQtEventFiler.create_key_event.

- Made sure all keys contribute to lossage
.. @+node:ekr.20110611085637.5012: *6* 4.9 b3: New features
- Simplified Leo's key handling, an important improvement to Leo's core.

- Changed names of commands so they have common prefixes

    Any custom key bindings (none are bound by default) will have to change.
    
    The new prefixes are::
    
        abbrev-     abbreviation commands
        buffer-     buffer command
        directory-  director commands
        file-       file commands
        gc-         garbage collection
        macro-      macro expansion
        rectangle-  rectangle commands
        register    register commands
        
    The already existing prefixes are::
    
        apropos-    help
        ddabrev-    dynamic abbreviations
        find-       find commands
        isearch-    incremental search
        print-      print information
        run-        run unit tests
        toggle-     toggle settings
        yank-       yank
        

- Finished macros

    The macro-load and macro-save are as simple as possible.

    No further work will be done on macros unless somebody really wants these commands.


- Added support for word-only option for regular expressions

When the word-only option is in effect, Leo ensures that the search pattern
begins and ends with the '\b' anchor.

- Leo's startup code now forces the qt gui: it changes qttabs to qt.

- Added support for expanded sections in plugin.  Added three new options:

    expand_noweb_references
    
       True: Replace references by definitions.
       Definitions must be descendants of the referencing node.
    
    ignore_noweb_definitions
    
        True: ignore section definition nodes.
    
    expand_noweb_recursively
    
        True: recursively expand definitions by expanding any
        references found in definitions.
.. @+node:ekr.20110613172008.15106: *5* New in 4.9 b4
- Running all unit tests leaves all files unchanged. This was a major annoyance.

- Leo now does a keyboard-quit when deactivating a window.

- Fixed an ancient bug: everything after @all was put in the wrong node!

- Fixed an ancient bug: wrap-around search now restarts when find pattern changes.

- Fixed an ancient bug: F-keys end incremental searches.

- Fixed a serious recent problem with commands dispatched from menus The Shift
  modifier was deleted from all commands executed by selecting an item in menus!
  A new unit test checks that menus behave as expected.

- Dismiss splash screen before putting up the dialog that asks for an ID.
.. @+node:ekr.20110616100929.14851: *5* New in 4.9 rc1
- When running on MacOS, Leo uses the qt gui when the qttabs gui is requested.

- Leo now looks in home/.leo/Icons directory for icons before looking in the
  leo/Icons directory.
  http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/80163aec96b8ea45/4f58418924172252

- Fixed bug 797470: File data sometimes silently erased when the tangler fails.
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/leo-editor/+bug/797470 This was a serious bug, but
  it could happen only when saving an erroneous file twice.

- Fixed bug 798194: --maximized has no effect
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/leo-editor/+bug/798194

- Added the @bool forbid_invalid_completions setting.

- Non-plain keys, such as Ctrl-s, abort auto-completion and are interpreted as
  usual.

- Don't mark the .leo file as changed when setting orphan bit. There is no need:
  the orphan bits will ensure errors get reported if the file is saved.

- Disabled the open-compare-window command. It is/was a Tk only command.

- The open-python-window command fails more gracefully It issues a message
  instead of crashing if idlelib does not exist.
.. @+node:ekr.20101025080245.5805: *4* Leo 4.8
.. @+node:ekr.20101025080245.6077: *5* New sentinels
.. _`simplest possible`: http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/8b659c96720afd53/628a09779ca9e8c6
.. _`org-mode`: http://orgmode.org/

Leo now writes \@file files with the `simplest possible`_ sentinel lines.

    - Eliminated \@-node sentinels.
    - Eliminated \@nl and \@nonl sentinels.
    - Simpler representation of \@doc and \@ in sentinels.
    - Simplified representation of \@others and section references.
    - Use a scheme much like Emacs `org-mode`_ to represent headline level.

The result is, provably, the simplest possible representation of Leo's outline
structure in external files.
.. @+node:ekr.20101025080245.6078: *5* Drag and drop files into Leo
The Qt Gui now supports drag and drop in Leo outlines.

You can drag files into Leo.  Leo will create \@file or \@auto nodes if appropriate.
.. @+node:ekr.20101025080245.5980: *5* Scripting improvements
.. _`p.deletePositionsInList`: http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/0aa8d9d17f6300b8#
.. _`g.findTestScript`: http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/a108d70400b28dc9#

- The execute-script now calls execfile (or its equivalent when using Python 3k)
  when @bool write_script_file = True. This allows pdb (or pudb) to show the
  text of Leo scripts!

- Added `p.deletePositionsInList`_, an important new helper.

- Added `g.findTestScript`_, an important new pattern for sharing code in Leo
  scripts, including scripts in @test nodes.

    Suppose there is common code that I want to include in several unit tests::

        class Hello():
            def __init__(self,name='john'):
                self.name=name
                print('hello %s' % name)

    I put this in a node called 'Common test code'. Now the unit tests can "import"
    the code as follows::

        exec(g.findTestScript('Common test code'))

    After this exec statement completes the class Hello is available to the test
    code! This is something that I've wanted to do forever.
.. @+node:ekr.20101025080245.6080: *5* Improved @url nodes
If the body text is non-empty, it is assumed to contain the URL.
This is a remarkably important improvement--it allows the
headline to contain a description of the url.
.. @+node:ekr.20101104173324.5141: *5* New & improved commands
- Added code-to-rst command.

- Completed cascade-windows and minimize-all-windows commands.

- Created head-to-prev-node and tail-to-next-node commands.

- Removed mark-clones command.  It is useless in the one-node world.

- Added extract-python-method command.
.. @+node:ekr.20101025080245.6079: *6* Improved abbreviations commands
When abbreviation mode is on (abbrev-mode toggles this mode) Leo will expand
abbreviations as you type. Type the name of an abbreviation, followed by a
space. As soon as you type the space, Leo will replace the name by the
abbreviations value. You can undo the replacement as usual.

Note that defining any abbreviation automatically turns on abbreviation
mode.

The add-global-abbreviation command (<alt-x>add-gl<tab><return>) takes the
selected text as the replacement value of the abbreviation. The minibuffer
prompts you for the name of the abbreviation.

Three new settings apply to the abbreviation commands:

- @bool enable-abbreviations (default: False)

    When true, enables substitution of abbreviations.

- @data global-abbreviations

- @data abbreviations

      In both cases, body text contains lines of the form::

        name=value

      name is the abbreviation name, value is the substituted text. Whitespace
      is ignore around the name, but is significant in the value. Abbreviation
      names may contain only alphabetic characters, but may start with the '@'
      sign.

      By *convention* @data global-abbreviations setting should be defined in
      myLeoSettings.leo, while @data abbreviations should be defined in other
      .leo files. Regardless of where they are defined, abbreviations in @data
      abbreviation nodes will override settings (with the same name) in @data
      global-abbreviations nodes.
.. @+node:ekr.20101025080245.6081: *5* New plugins
- The screenshots.py plugin helps make slide shows containing many screen shots.
.. @+node:ekr.20101025080245.6006: *5* New settings & command-line args
- Leo can now open multiple files from the command line.

- You can now set a proportional font to use in all "@language plain" nodes.
   Specify fonts in @font nodes::

        @font plain null font

            plain_null_font_family = Times New Roman
            plain_null_font_size = 16
            plain_null_font_slant = roman
            plain_null_font_weight = bold

  That is, the actual font specs are in the body text.  Everything
  except \@font is ignored in the headline.

  Specify font colors with \@color nodes::

        @color plain null color = black

- Added support for minibuffer colors. Added the following options with the
  indicated defaults::

    @color minibuffer_background_color = lightblue
    @color minibuffer_warning_color = lightgrey

- Added support for \@string qt-toolbar-location = <spot>

    Valid values for <spot> are top,bottom,left,right

- Added support for \@bool write_expansion_bits_in_leo_files.

- The ``-screen-shot`` command-line argument tells Leo to take a screenshot and exit.

- The ``--window-size`` command-line argument specifies the initial size of the Leo
  window.  This is especially useful with the ``screen-shot`` command-line argument::

    --window-size=600x900  # <height> x <width>, in pixels.

- Added support for @bool at_auto_separate_non_def_nodes option.

    When true, the @auto file importers put inter-def code in their own node.
    The default (legacy mode) is False.
.. @+node:ekr.20101025080245.5985: *5* Other improvements
.. _`Reorganized`: http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/d02df89c0b831a7c

- Several important improvements to Leo's installer for Windows.

- Leo doesn't create @chapter nodes for new files.

- Leo now uses PyEnchant to check spelling.

    This is much safer than the old Aspell wrapper.

- All \@auto nodes end with a newline.

- Leo now writes @edit nodes like @nosent nodes.

- Added legend for print-settings command.

- Improved the importer for elisp.

- Added an .ini importer.

- Created introductory slide shows.

- `Reorganized`_ the users guide.

- Improved the installation instructions.

- Added support for .nsi files.
.. @+node:ekr.20100129054823.11924: *4* Leo 4.7
.. @+node:ekr.20101025080245.6088: *5* The one-node world
Leo 4.7 accomplishes something I long thought to be impossible: the unification
of vnodes and tnodes. tnodes now longer exist: vnodes contain all data. The Aha
that made this possible is that iterators and positions allow a single node to
appear in more than one place in a tree traversal.
.. @+node:ekr.20100129054823.17680: *5* Leo supports Python 3.x
Leo requires Python 2.6 or above, including Python 3.0 and above.
.. @+node:ekr.20100129054823.11928: *5* Improved file handling
- Leo now treats @file nodes just like it treats @thin nodes. This makes Leo
  much safer to use in cooperative environments that use source code control
  systems. As part of this change, Leo no longer supports @noref nodes.

- @auto-rst now works much more reliably.

- Leo now has a simple, robust, and extremely useful scheme to recover from
  clone conflicts, no matter how they may arise. This removes all the dread from
  "node changed" messages. It is easy to see what the changes were, and it is
  easy to choose what, if anything to do.

  When a clone conflict occurs, you will see a red message in the log pane and a
  "Recovered Nodes" node as the last top-level node. This node has one child per
  red message. Each of these children contains two nodes: an "old" node and a
  "new" node. Unless there are multiple conflicts for a single node, the "new"
  node will have "won": every clone contains the new node's headline and body
  text. All these nodes are plain nodes, *not* clones. It is up to you to change
  the corresponding clone nodes if you choose to do so.

- Leo minimizes unnecessary changes to .leo files. Leo writes outline-size and
  orientation to the cache in your .leo directory. This eliminates unnecessary
  changes to .leo files.

- Leo now creates temporary files in the systems standard temporary directory.
  This prevents Leo from over-writing user-generated .bak files.
.. @+node:ekr.20100129054823.11931: *5* New command-line options
- The ``--debug`` command-line option sets g.debug.

- The ``--version`` command-line option causes Leo
  to print it's version and exit.

.. @+node:ekr.20100211221936.7098: *5* New commands
- The clear-cache and clear-all-caches commands.
.. @+node:ekr.20100129054823.11934: *5* New settings
The qt colorizer now supports font specifications in @font nodes.
.. @+node:ekr.20100129054823.11935: *5* Improved plugins
Added options for vim plugin. The setting::

    @string vim_trigger_event = icondclick2

is the default. It opens vim when the user double-clicks the icon box.
Alternatives are::

    @string vim_trigger_event = iconclick2
    @string vim_trigger_event = select2

The former opens vim on single clicks in the icon bar.
The latter opens vim whenever a new node is selected in Leo.

.. @+node:ekr.20090324145450.20: *4* Leo 4.6
.. @+node:ekr.20090620073906.12095: *5* Improved unit testing
- leoDynamicTest.py now supports a ``--path`` argument giving the .leo file.
  This is so useful!

- leoDynamicTest.py now honors the ``--silent`` argument.

- leoTest.runUnitTestLeoFile runs all unit tests in a given .leo file
  in a separate process.

- leoTest.runTestsExternally calls runUnitTestLeoFile after creating
  dynamicUnitTest.leo.

- When reporting that no unit tests were found, all unit tests commands tell
  whether the entire outline or just the selected outline was searched.
  This fixes sometimes-misleading error messages.

- test.leo contains a 'run-test.leo-tests' button.

- leoPy.leo contains a 'run-all-core-tests' button.
.. @+node:ekr.20090324145450.23: *5* Improved file handling
- Leo opens a default .leo file if no other is specified, using the @string
  default_leo_file setting. The default for this setting is::

    ~/.leo/workbook.leo

- Added escapes for underindented lines. The escape is specified by the @string
  underindent-escape-string setting. By default, this escape is \- If a line
  starts with \-N, Leo will write the line with N fewer spaces than expected.

- Leo now warns when attempting to write a file that has been changed outside of
  Leo. This prevents bzr reversions.

- Leo tests syntax of .py files when saving them.

- Leo can now open any file into an @edit node. This allows Leo to be associated
  with the edit action of .py files. Like this::

    C:\Python26\python.exe "c:\leo.repo\trunk\launchLeo.py" --gui=qt %1 %2

- Leo now warns if when writing an @auto node if the the file exists and the
  node has not been read previously.  This prevents a newly-created
  @auto node from overwriting an existing file.
.. @+node:ekr.20090620082840.5608: *5* Improved handling of rST files
Added support for @auto-rst nodes. These import reStructuredText (rST) files
so that the files can be "round-tripped" without introducing extraneous changes.
This makes Leo a superb environment for using rST.
.. @+node:ekr.20090324145450.27: *5* New code features
.. _`autoCompleter.getExternalCompletions`: http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/4ad91984a6d0acac
.. _`c.getNodePath and c.getNodeFileName`: http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/3b5f1232ecc6bba7

- Added `autoCompleter.getExternalCompletions`_.

- Added g.posList.

- c.config.doEnabledPlugins sets g.app.config.enabledPluginsFileName

- Added the following properties:
    - p.b, t.b and v.b return the body string of the position or node.
    - p.h, t.h and v.h return the head string of the position or node.
    - t.u and v.u return the uA of the node.
    - p.gnx, t.gnx and v.gnx return the gnx of the position or node.

- Added script to leoSettings.leo to ensure all menu items are valid.

- c.config.getSettingSource(setting_name)
  returns the name of the file which Leo used to determine the setting:

    - D indicates default settings.
    - F indicates the file being loaded
    - L indicates leoSettings.leo
    - M indicates myLeoSettings.leo

- Predefined 'self' in @test/@suite nodes.

- Added `c.getNodePath and c.getNodeFileName`_.
.. @+node:ekr.20090324145450.36: *5* New command-line options
- The ``--config`` command-line option specifies a single config (.leo) file
  to use for configuration.
  See http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/f3f95d93bcd93b94

- The ``--file=fileName`` command-line option loads a file.
  Only .zip and .leo extensions are allowed at present.

- The ``--gui=name`` command-line option specifies the gui to use.
  The valid values are ``--gui=qt`` and ``--gui=tk``.
.. @+node:ekr.20090324145450.40: *5* New commands
- Added smart home (back-to-home) command.

- Added support for standard behavior of Tab and Shift-Tab keys.
  The tab key indents the text selection, if there is one;
  otherwise, the tab key insert a tab or blanks, depending on the @tabwidth setting.
  Shift-Tab always unindents one or more lines.

- The open command creates @edit nodes when opening non-.leo files
  The open file dialog now shows all files by default.
  Selecting a non-.leo file will load that file into a new node in the present outline.

- Added added pdb minibuffer command.
  This works, but stops Leo in the middle of the command-handling logic.
  You may get the commander c by stepping out into
  k.masterKeyHandler or k.masterCommandHandler.
  Using c, you can then get all other info.

- Improved the isearch commands.

- find-clone-all is a synonym for clone-find-all.

- open-quickstart-leo command opens leo/doc/quickstart.leo.

- The Alt-Right and Alt-Left keys (expand-and-go-right and contract-or-go-left
  commands) now move to the previous or next node if now left/right movement is
  possible.
.. @+node:ekr.20090324145450.46: *5* New and improved directives
- Added @nocolor-node directive.

- Improved \@path handling.
.. @+node:ekr.20090324145450.49: *5* New settings
.. _`meta keys`: http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/b6a39ed672a28c65?pli=1

- @string default_leo_file = ~/.leo/workbook.leo

- @string underindent-escape-string = \-

- @int icon_bar_widgets_per_row

- Added support for `meta keys`_.

- The qt gui is now the default.

- The old bindings bound the PageUp/Down keys to back/forward page commands, and
  these commands work only for text.

  The new default bindings in leoSettings.leo: @keys EKR bindings are::

    back-page                       ! text = PageUp
    back-page-extend-selection      ! text = Shift-PageUp
    forward-page                    ! text = PageDn
    forward-page-extend-selection   ! text = Shift-PageDn

    scroll-down-half-page   ! tree = Shift-PageDn
    scroll-down-page        ! tree = PageDn
    scroll-up-half-page     ! tree = Shift-PageUp
    scroll-up-page          ! tree = PageUp    

- @bool enable_alt_ctrl_bindings.
  The default is False, needed for AltGr functionality on Windows.
.. @+node:ekr.20090324145450.54: *5* Plugins
- Improved nav_buttons plugin and corresponding nodeHistory class.

- Created qtGui and tkGui plugins.

- Created leoGuiPluginsRef.leo.

- Leo issues an error message if a non-existent plugin appears
  in an @enabled-plugin node.

- New plugins: spydershell.py, qtframecommands.py, and mod_framesize.py.
.. @+node:ekr.20080806211440.185: *4* Leo 4.5
.. @+node:ekr.20080806211440.188: *5* Major new features
.. _`v.uA's`: http://groups.google.com/group/leo-editor/browse_thread/thread/750bb3099090f5b

- Added support for @shadow files.
  This is a major breakthrough.
  See the `Using @shadow`_ chapter for full details.

- Added much improved support for vim bindings.

- Allow `v.uA's`_ in @file and @shadow nodes.
.. @+node:ekr.20080806211440.253: *5* Major code reorganizations
- Leo now uses a sax-based parser to read .leo files.
  This makes it possible to extend Leo's file format without invalidating previous versions of Leo.

- Leo now supports the so-called 'Graph World'.
  When g.unified_nodes is True, Leo moves all information from tnodes into vnodes.

- Leo now uses a new key binding scheme.
  This allows substantially simpler key bindings. Indeed, most per-pane bindings
  have been eliminated.
  Added support for kill bindings.

- Leo is now an installable package.
  To make this work, Leo adds os.curdir to sys.path if needed on startup.

- Reorganized Leo's drawing and focus code.
  As a result, calls to c.beginUpdate and c.endUpdate are no longer needed.

- Leo is now ready for Python 3.x:
  Change most print statements to calls to g.pr.
.. @+node:ekr.20080806211440.256: *5* Minor new features
- Added g.Tracer class.  This is a Python 'debugger' that computes a call graph.
  To trace a function and its callers, put the following at the function's start::

    g.startTracer()

- The find-character command now finds characters across line boundaries.

- Set cwd in read/write commands. This affect the following commands:
  open, save, save-as, save-to, read-outline-only, read-file-into-node,
  write-file-from-node and all the import/export commands.

- Leo creates the .leo folder in the user's HOME directory, and puts several configuration files there.
  Leo looks for myLeoSettings.leo in HOME/.leo.
  Leo uses os.path.expanduser("~") if there is no home setting.
.. @+node:ekr.20080806211440.189: *5* New settings
- The default settings for @shadow files are now located in leoSettings.leo in the node::

        @settings-->File options-->Shadow files

    The defaults for these settings are::

        @string shadow_prefix = x
        @string shadow_subdir = .leo_shadow

- Added support for @bool fixedWindow option.

    Leo suppresses marks, expansion state, orphan bits and current position bits
    when writing fixed .leo files. As a result, all nodes will be collapsed and
    the root node will always be selected when Leo opens a fixed .leo file.

    You can optionally specify the size and position on the screen of fixed .leo
    files by putting an '@data fixedWindowPosition' node in the
    \@settings tree of myLeoSettings.leo or leoSettings.leo.  You should
    **not** put such a node in the fixed .leo file itself--everyone who
    opens the file would get that fixed position.

    The body of the '@data fixedWindowPosition' node should contain
    something like this::

        # Must be four entries: width,height,left,top.
        # Put this in myLeoSettings.leo, **not** in individual .leo files.

        1200
        800
        50
        50

- Added @bool cleo_color_ignore = True

    This determines whether cleo colors @ignore headlines. The default is True.
.. @+node:ekr.20080314081157.127: *4* Leo 4.4.8
.. @+node:ekr.20080314081157.124: *5* New features
- Better support for unicode in \@auto trees.

- All import commands now honor \@path

- Leo now supports arguments to minibuffer commands.

- Leo can now translate messages sent to Leo's log. Rather than using an '_'
  function to denote strings to be translated, Leo's g.es and g.es_print
  functions translate "odd" (first, third, fifth) arguments, leaving "even"
  arguments untranslated. Keyword arguments, color, newline, etc. are never
  translated. g.translateString does the actual translation using
  `Python's gettext`_ module.

- \@menu items may not refer to commands created by @button and @command nodes.
.. @+node:ekr.20080314081157.128: *5* New and improved plugins
- The ipython plugin creates a simple, powerful, effective bridge between IPython and Leo.

- Added support for @bool open_with_save_on_update setting. If True, Leo will
  automatically save the outline whenever an external editor changes the
  outline.

.. @+node:ekr.20070809145744: *4* Leo 4.4.4
Leo 4.4.4 contains many important features originally planned for later releases.
The highlights of Leo 4.4.4:

- **The Great Graph Aha**:
  A Leo outline doesn't have to *be* an arbitrary graph in order to *represent* an arbitrary graph.

  That is, simple scripts allow Leo outlines to represent arbitrary
  directed graphs. There is no need for a separate 'graph world'. The graphed.py
  plugin is a direct result of this Aha. It allows you to create general graphs
  from Leo outlines.

- Support for **@auto nodes**.  Such nodes allow people to collaborate using Leo
  without inserting Leo sentinels in the files Leo generates.

- **@menus trees** in settings files create all of Leo's menus.  It is now dead
  easy to make Leo's menus look the way you want.

- **@buttons trees** in settings files create common @button nodes created in all
  Leo outlines.

- A new, faster, **colorizer plugin** replaces the __jEdit_colorizer__ plugin.

- New commands for **resolving cvs conflicts**.

- Leo's core is now compatible with jython.
.. @+node:ekr.20071004103659: *5* The Great Graph Aha
The Great Graph Aha is:

A Leo outline doesn't have to *be* an arbitrary graph in order to *represent* an arbitrary graph.

So the graph world is unnecessary because we can use Leo nodes and trees as data
to other graphing packages.** That is, Python scripts can build arbitrary graphs
using Leo's existing nodes and trees. And Python scripts can manipulate those
graphs. And Python scripts could do the reverse: manipulate the Leo outline by
traversing general graphs. So there is no need to complicate Leo's fundamental
data structures. Hurray! Instead, we build on the strengths of already existing
graphing packages.

The Great Graph Aha created the opportunity for immediate action:

1. test.leo contains the essential scripts to implement graphs in Leo files.
   These short, simple, self-contained, easily modifiable scripts make possible
   everything ever envisaged by the (now-defunct) graph world project::

    leo2graph: convert a normal Leo tree to a NetworkX graph. 
    at-graph2graph: convert an @graph tree to a NetworkX graph. 
    at-networkx2graph: convert an @networkx tree to a NetworkX graph 
    at-networkx2at-graph: create an @graph tree from an @networkx tree.

2. The graphed plugin allows users to manipulate parts of Leo outlines as if
they were general graphs. It is still early days for this exciting plugin.
.. @+node:ekr.20070806090226.15: *5* Added support for @auto files
.. @+node:ekr.20070806095535.1: *6* What @auto does
@auto trees allows people to use Leo in collaborative environments without using
sentinels in the files Leo generates. In contrast to @nosent, @auto trees can
change when the corresponding file changes outside of Leo.

Leo will automatically recreate (import) all @auto trees when reading a .leo
file, and will write all dirty @auto trees when saving a .leo file. There are
two exceptions to this statement:

1. Leo will never read (import) or write an @auto tree if
the root @auto tree is under the influence of an @ignore directive.

2. Saving a .leo file does not save @auto nodes if a) they haven't been changed
or b) they do not contain a **significant** amount of information. An @auto tree
contains a significant amount of information if it has  children or if the
root node contains more than 10 characters.

Leo creates @auto trees by parsing the corresponding external file. Parsers
create descendant nodes of the @auto tree: one node for each class, method and
function in the external file.

Parsers presently exist for C, elisp, Java, Pascal, PHP and Python. Leo
determines the language using the file's extension. If no parser exists for a
language, the entire body of an @auto tree contains a significant amount of
information if it has any children or if the root node contains more than 10
non-blank lines. the external file is copied to the body of the @auto node.

Leo does not write the contents of @auto trees to .leo files. In this respect,
@auto trees work much like @file trees. @auto trees whose root node is under the
scope of an @ignore directive *will* be written to the .leo, just like @file
trees.
.. @+node:ekr.20070809141529: *6* Perfect import checks
Leo performs several checks to ensure that the result of importing an external
file will be equivalent to the file that writing the @auto tree would produce.

These checks can produces **errors** or **warnings**. Errors indicate a
potentially serious problem. Leo inserts an @ignore directive in the @auto tree
if any error is found. This @ignore directive prevents the @auto tree from
modifying the external file. If you @ignore directive, a later write of the
@auto tree will attempt to fix the problems that gave rise to the errors. There
are no guarantees however.

**Strict languages** are languages like Python for which leading whitespace is
especially significant. Before importing a file for a strict language, Leo
**regularizes** the leading whitespace of all lines of the original source file.
That is, Leo converts blanks to tabs or tabs to blanks depending on the value of
the @tabwidth directive in effect for the @auto node. Leo cannot guarantee to
reproduce the original source file exactly if problems are discovered while
regularizing leading whitespace.

After importing a file, Leo verifies that writing the @auto node would create
the same file as the original file. For strict languages, the comparison must be
exact, or nearly so. For non-strict languages, differences in leading whitespace
generate warnings, not errors.

File comparison mismatches can arise for several reasons:

1. Bugs in the import parsers. Please report any suspected bugs immediately.

2. Underindented lines in classes, methods or functions in strict languages. An
   **underindented line** is a line that is indented less then the starting line
   of the class, method or function in which it appears. Leo outlines can not
   represent such lines exactly: every line of node implicitly has at least the
   indentation of any unindented line of the node.

Leo will issue a warning (not an error) for underindented Python comment lines.
Such lines can not change the meaning of Python programs.
.. @+node:ekr.20070806101412: *6* Commands related to @auto
Three new commands in the File:Read/Write menu allow you to manually read and
write @auto nodes from the presently selected outline. As always, an @ignore
directive in the @auto node or its ancestors will suppress any of these
commands:

- The Read @auto Nodes (read-at-auto-nodes) command reads all @auto nodes in the
  presently selected outline. An @ignore directive will suppress this import.

- The Write @auto Nodes (write-at-auto-nodes) command writes all @auto nodes. An
  @ignore directive will suppress this import. Caution: the write will occur even
  if Leo has not previously read the @auto node.

- The Write Dirty @auto Nodes (write-dirty-at-auto-nodes) is the same as the
  write-at-auto-nodes command, except that only changed @auto trees are written.

Most users will rarely use these explicit commands, because reading and writing
.leo files handles @auto nodes well enough. However, you can use the
read-at-auto-nodes command to update @auto nodes without having to reload the
.leo file.
.. @+node:ekr.20070806100055: *6* Extending the code: adding new parsers
All present parsers are short overrides of a powerful base parser class. Thus,
it would be simple to add support for other languages. See the node::

    @file leoImport.py-->Import-->Scanners for createOutline

in leoPy.leo to see how easy it is to create new parsers.

.. @+node:ekr.20070920092716: *5* New commands for resolving cvs conflicts
The so-called resolve-cvs-conflict project has resolved itself into small,
easily understood commands.

The **read-file-into-node** command prompts for a filename, and creates an node
whose headline is @read-file-into-node <filename> and whose body text is the
entire contents of the file.

The **write-file-from-node** command writes the body text of the selected not to a file.
If the headline of the presently selected node starts with @read-file-into-node
the command use the filename that follows in the headline. Otherwise, the
command prompts for a filename.

When a cvs conflict occurs, the user will:

- read the file into a node using the read-file-into-node command,

- fix the conflict, as with any other editor, and

- write the file with the write-file-from-node command.

Any file can be fixed in this way, including external files and .leo files. The
only complication is that the user must not change sentinel lines. Two new
commands check the contents of a node: The **check-derived-file** and
**check-leo-file** commands tell whether a trial read of the presently selected
node can be done successfully. The check-derived-file command assumes the body
text is a external file; the check-leo-file command assumes the body text is an
entire .leo file.

The **compare-leo-outlines** command prompts for another (presumably similar)
.leo file that will be compared with the presently selected outline file (main
window). It then creates clones of all inserted, deleted and changed nodes.
.. @+node:ekr.20070809145744.5: *5* New kinds of settings trees
.. @+node:ekr.20071001122703: *6* @buttons trees
All @buttons tree in a settings file defines global buttons that are created in
the icon area of all .leo files. You define @button nodes in the @buttons tree
as usual.
.. @+node:ekr.20071004110818: *6* @menus trees
Leo creates its menus from the @menu and @item nodes in the @menus tree. Within
@menus trees, @menu nodes create menus and @item nodes create menu items.

The menu name always follows @menu. If the menu name is 'Plugins', Leo will
create the Plugins menu and populate the menu by calling the
'create-optional-menus' hook. This creates the Plugins menu as usual. Nested
@menu nodes define submenus.

The command name follows @item. If the body text of an @item node exists, this
body text is the menu name. Otherwise, the menu name is the command name.
However, if the command name starts with a '*', hyphens are removed from the
menu name. Menu names and command names may contain a single ampersand (&). If
present, the following character is underlined in the name. If the command name
in an @item node is just a hyphen (-), the item represents a menu separator.
.. @+node:ekr.20070809145744.6: *5* New plugins
- The graphed plugin allows users to manipulate parts of Leo outlines as if they
  were general graphs. It is still early days for this exciting plugin.

- The threading_colorizer plugin replaces the __jEdit_colorizer__ plugin. This
  plugin features an elegant new algorithm that has much better performance and
  eliminates almost all flash.
.. @+node:ekr.20071005100213: *5* Leo's core is now compatible with jython
Essentially all of Leo's startup code now runs with jython 2.2 and the (unfinished!) swing gui.
.. @+node:ekr.20071026180804: *5* Improved prototype for icons in headlines
The prototype in test.leo now will use PIL (Python Imaging Library) if
available, so many more kinds of icons can be used. Buttons now exist to add
icons to do the following:

- Add any icon to any node.
- Delete all icons from a single node or the entire tree.
- Print the icon files associated with a node.
- Print the sizes of icons in a directory.

Fixed a bug in the icon handling in the outline widget that caused
duplicate icons not to be drawn properly.
.. @+node:ekr.20070809145744.7: *5* Minor improvements
- See the release notes for a list of bugs fixed in Leo 4.4.4.

- Added the 'clear-all-marks' hook.

- Added button font setting. See the node::

    "@settings-->Fonts-->@font button font" in leoSettings.leo.

- Plugins and scripts may call the c.frame.canvas.createCanvas method to create a
  log tab containing a Tk.Canvas widget. Here is an example script::

    log = c.frame.log ; tag = 'my-canvas'
    w = log.canvasDict.get(tag)
    if not w:
        w = log.createCanvas(tag)
        w.configure(bg='yellow')
    log.selectTab(tag)

- Improved the yank and yank-pop commands and added @bool add_ws_to_kill_ring setting.

- Improved the debug command: it now adds the following code to the beginning of debug scripts::

    class G:
        def es(s,c=None):
          pass
    g = G()

- Added the @bool rst3 strip_at_file_prefixes setting.

- Added the g.app.inBridge ivar.

- Added @bool big_outline_pane setting. False (legacy): Top pane contains outline and log panes.
  True: Top pane contains only the outline pane.  Bottom pane contains body and log panes.

The highlights of Leo 4.4.3:

- @test and @suite nodes may now be embedded directly in external files.
- Added support for chapters in Leo's core.
- Added support for zipped .leo files.
- The new leoBridge module allows full access to all of Leo's capabilities
  from programs running outside of Leo.
- Better support for the winpdb debugger.
- Added support for @enabled-plugins and @open-with nodes in settings files.
- Removed all gui-dependent code from Leo's core.

    forward-end-word
    forward-end-word-extend-selection
.. @+node:ekr.20060928172457.4: *5* New features
- Added support for controlling Leo from Emacs_ with pymacs_.
  See the `Leo and Emacs`_ chapter for full details.
- Added Minibuffer and Settings submenus of the Cmds menu.
- At long last Leo creates a proper help menu on the Mac.
- Added a new convention for menu tables. If the first item (a string
  representing the menu label) starts with '*' Leo will convert hyphens to
  spaces and upcase the label. This convention allows a single string to
  represent both the menu label and its associated minibuffer command. As part
  of this reorganization, all menu tables in Leo's core now use only strings.
  This is an essential precondition to supporting @menu nodes in
  leoSettings.leo.
- Leo's Help menu now contains the Open scripts.leo command.
- Leo uses ctypes to import Aspell when run from Python 2.5 or later.
  Leo no longer needs Python-specific versions of aspell.dll.
- Added support for x-windows middle-button paste.
  This only works when the paste is made in the pane containing the selected text.
- Leo looks for myLeoSettings.leo files in the same place Leo looks for leoSettings.leo files.
- Created three scripts (in test.leo) that help create unit tests for Leo's edit commands.
  Create Created runEditCommandTest for use by these scripts.
- Improved print-bindings command.
  The bindings are sorted by prefix: this is a big help in understanding bindings.
  For each prefix, first print items with only a single character after the prefix.
- Made writing .leo files faster.
  The new code almost exactly twice as fast as the old.
- Added p.archivedPosition.
  This is a key first step towards Leap 204.
- Integrated sax with read logic.
- You can now store settings in myLeoSettings.leo without fear of those settings
  being changed by cvs updates or in future versions of Leo.
- Eliminated unnecessary redraws when moving the cursor in the outline pane.
- Much faster navigation through the outline using Alt-arrow keys.
- When focus is in the outline pane, you can move to headlines by typing the first letter of headlines.
- The find command now closes nodes not needed to show the node containing the present match.
- Numerous changes that make Leo easier to use without using a mouse.
- Many new minibuffer commands now appear in the Cmds menu.

Further improved outline navigation:

- Generalized navigation in outline pane to ignore @file, @thin, etc prefixes.
- Made outline navigation cumulative.
  When keystrokes in the outline pane are typed 'close' together Leo first tries to look
  for prefix + ch, where ch is the character just typed and prefix is the previous match.
  The term 'close together' is specified by the setting @float outline_nav_extend_delay.
  The outline search revers to a single-character if the extended search
  fails, so in fact the delay is not too significant. In practice everything works
  well without me thinking at all about what is happening.
.. @+node:ekr.20060928172457.5: *5* New and improved plugins
- Improved the mod_scripting plugin. Every button created by the plugin creates
  a corresponding command. The command name is the 'cleaned' version of the
  button name. Likewise, the plugin also creates a delete-x-button command,
  where x is the command name as just discussed. So now you can delete script
  buttons without right-clicking.
- Made 'About Plugin' dialog scrollable.
- Fixed bugs in groupoperations, multifile, nodenavigator and shortcut_button plugins.
- The rst3 plugin now registers the rst3-process-tree command.
- The leoOPML.py plugin defines commands to read and write OPML files.
- The slideshow.py plugin allows Leo to run slideshows defined by @slideshow and @slide nodes.
- The leo_to_rtf and leo_to_html plugins create rtf and html files from Leo outlines.
- The paste_as_headlines.py plugins creates multiple headlines at once.
- The word_count.py plugin.

Improved the mod_scripting plugin:

- Made showing the Run Script button optional.
- The Script Button button now creates the press-script-button-button command.
- A new utility method does a much better job of massaging button and command names.
.. @+node:ekr.20061009111417.11: *5* Settings
- Removed .leoRecentFiles.txt from the distribution and cvs and added @bool
  write_recent_files_as_needed. The presence or absence of .leoRecentFiles.txt
  no longer controls whether Leo creates and updates .leoRecentFiles.txt.
- Added @bool insert_new_nodes_at_end.
- Added @bool select_all_text_when_editing_headlines.
  Creating a new node always selects the entire text, regardless of this option.
- Leo looks for myLeoSettings.leo files in the same place Leo looks for leoSettings.leo files.
- Added settings for all mod_scripting switches.
- Added @bool collapse_nodes_during_finds.
  This greatly speeds searches that used to open many nodes.
  See: http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=3935780
- Added @bool outline_pane_has_initial_focus.
- Added @bool sparse_move_outline_left.
- Added bindings for Alt-Shift-Arrow keys to force an outline move.
- Added @bool use_sax_based_read = False.
  True:  Use a sax-based parser to read .leo files.
  This is slower than using Leo's legacy xml parser, but may solve some unicode problems.

Changed default settings::

    focus-to-body = Alt-D
    focus-to-tree = Alt-T
    toggle-extend-mode = Alt-3
.. @+node:ekr.20060929043325.1: *5* ZODB scripting

  Pressing the Shortcut button creates *another* button which when pressed
  will select the presently selected node at the time the button was created.

.. @+node:ekr.20060620094033.2: *4* Leo 4.4
The main features of Leo 4.4 are:

- An Emacs-like mini-buffer: you can now execute any command by typing its long
  name, with tab completion.

- Many new commands, including cursor and screen movement, basic character, word
  and paragraph manipulation, and commands to manipulate buffers, the kill ring,
  regions and rectangles. You can use Leo without using a mouse.

- Flexible key bindings and input modes. You can emulate the operation of Emacs,
  Vim, or any other editor.

- A tabbed log pane. The Find and Spell Check commands now use tabs instead of
  dialogs, making those commands much easier to use. Plugins or scripts can easily
  create new tabs. The Completion tab shows possible typing completions.

- Autocompletion and calltips.  Autocompletion works much like tab completion.
  To enable autocompletion, bind a key to the auto-complete command.
